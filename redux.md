title: Redux
---

> Redux does not inherently support asynchronous actions, as stated before. So, we need some other way to accomplish communication with the backend. Thankfully, Redux does support middleware and much middleware has been designed to add asynchronous capability to Redux. We are going to use redux-thunk for simplicity.

> Having all application state centralized in a single place may sound radical, but it brings lots of benefits

> Props are a componentâ€™s configuration. They are received from above and immutable as far as the component receiving them is concerned.
