            <h1>Testing is difficult</h1>
            <p class="lead">Testing can be difficult. This is especially true with an application that was not written with testability in mind. If you have static methods and implementations using concrete references scattered throughout your code, you will have difficulty adding tests at a later date.<p>

            <h1>User stories</h1>
            <p class="lead">User stories are commonly used in Agile software development for requirement definitions. The format for a user story is fairly simple and consists of three parts: Role, Request, and Reason. 
            As a {Role} I want [Request} So that {Reason}

            <h1>Exceptiont</h1>
<p>One issue with the method of throwing when a speaker is not found is that it brings a possibly unexpected and abrupt end to the application flow. The entire logic path the application took to get to this method is now destroyed and the exception must be handled. Even when we handle the exception, C# uses extra CPU cycles on the first-chance exception error handling process. Sometimes throwing is definitely the right decision; however, exceptions should be reserved for truly exceptional events. As discussed earlier, it is far more likely that a Get could be called with an invalid ID than with a valid one. So, in this case it is not necessarily a properly exceptional event for an invalid speaker to be requested</p>
