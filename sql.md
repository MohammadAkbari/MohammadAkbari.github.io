## Number of Connections
```sql
SELECT 
    DB_NAME(dbid) as DBName, 
    COUNT(dbid) as NumberOfConnections,
    loginame as LoginName
FROM
    sys.sysprocesses
WHERE 
    dbid > 0
GROUP BY 
    dbid, loginame
```

## Top queries consuming High CPU [refrence](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/docast/2017/07/30/sql-high-cpu-troubleshooting-checklist/)
```sql
SELECT
  s.session_id,
  r.status,
  r.blocking_session_id 'Blk by',
  r.wait_type,
  r.wait_resource,
  r.wait_time / (1000 * 60) 'Wait M',
  r.cpu_time,
  r.logical_reads,
  r.reads,
  r.writes,
  r.total_elapsed_time / (1000 * 60) 'Elaps M',
  SUBSTRING(st.TEXT, (r.statement_start_offset / 2) + 1,

    WHEN -1 THEN DATALENGTH(st.TEXT)

##  Check/Change Isolation Level
```sql
DBCC USEROPTIONS

ALTER DATABASE [DB_NAME] SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK [IMMEDIATE|AFTER 30 SECONDS]
ALTER DATABASE [DB_NAME] SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON
ALTER DATABASE [DB_NAME] SET MULTI_USER
```
## TempDB

```
> The tempdb system database is a global resource that is available to all users connected to the instance of SQL Server and is used to hold the following:
>
> Temporary user objects that are explicitly created, such as: global or local temporary tables, temporary stored procedures, table variables, or cursors.
>
> Internal objects that are created by the SQL Server Database Engine, for example, work tables to store intermediate results for spools or sorting.
>
> Row versions that are generated by data modification transactions in a database that uses read-committed using row versioning isolation or snapshot isolation transactions.
>
> Row versions that are generated by data modification transactions for features, such as: online index operations, Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS), and AFTER triggers.
>
> Operations within tempdb are minimally logged. This enables transactions to be rolled back. tempdb is re-created every time SQL Server is started so that the system always starts with a clean copy of the database. Temporary tables and stored procedures are dropped automatically on disconnect, and no connections are active when the system is shut down. Therefore, there is never anything in tempdb to be saved from one session of SQL Server to another. Backup and restore operations are not allowed on tempdb.
>
> So for the vast majority of implementations, leaving tempdb where it is with all the default settings is fine.  But with databases that have stored procs or other code creating lots of temporary variables, cursors, and so forth, need to put tempdb on its own disk and treat it more like the transaction log.
