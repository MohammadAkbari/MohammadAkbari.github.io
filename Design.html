              <ol>
                <li>Rigidity: The design is hard to change.</li>
                <li>Fragility: The design is easy to break.</li>
                <li>Immobility: The design is hard to reuse.</li>
                <li>Viscosity: It is hard to do the right thing.</li>
                <li>Needless Complexity: Overdesign.</li>
                <li>Needless Repetition: Mouse abuse.</li>
                <li>Opacity: Disorganized expression.</li>
              </ol>

            <p>The smell of Rigidity is often a result of insufficient attention to The Open–Closed Principle (OCP).</p>
            <p>Agile teams apply principles to remove smells. They don’t apply principles when there are no smells. It is a
              mistake to unconditionally conform to a principle just because it is a principle. Principles are not a perfume to be
              liberally scattered all over the system. Overconformance to the principles leads to the design smell of Needless
              Complexity.</p>
