A promise is an object that is waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete, and when that operation completes, the promise is
either fulfilled or rejected. A promise object can be any of these three states:

 - fulfilled – when the promise succeeds
 - rejected – when the promise fails
 - pending – when it’s neither fulfilled or rejected

A pending promise may transition into a fulfilled or rejected state, and the promise is considered to be settled when it’s either fulfilled or rejected. It is important to note a settled promise is immutable, which means that once a promise is settled, it cannot be resettled.

ES6 has native support for promises.
