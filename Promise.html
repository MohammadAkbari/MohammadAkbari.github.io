          <h1>Promise</h1>
          <p class="lead">A promise is an object that is waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete, and when that operation completes, the promise is either fulfilled or rejected. A promise object can be any of these three states:</p>
          <p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">Fulfilled – when the promise succeeds</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Rejected – when the promise fails</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">pending</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <p>A pending promise may transition into a fulfilled or rejected state, and the promise is considered to be settled when it’s either fulfilled or rejected. It is important to note a settled promise is immutable, which means that once a promise is settled, it cannot be resettled.</p>
          <p>ES6 has native support for promises.</p>
